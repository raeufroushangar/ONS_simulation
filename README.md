# Virus Detection in CHO Cells Using Oxford Nanopore Sequencing Reads, BLAST, and the Hypergeometric Probability Distribution
This repository implements the research paper by Roushangar et al., where the data, code, and supplementary materials can all be found

### Requirements and Dependencies
The code has been executed in Python 3.10.6 (and there may be incompatibilities with different Python versions). BLAST+ 2.13.0 was used for sequence alignment against the Reference Viral DataBase (RVDB) culstured viersion 24.1. Other dependencies include: 
* pandas >= 1.5.1
* biopython >= 1.79
